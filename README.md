## Quick start up

This project was created with vue-cli. If you do not want to install Node and Vue, you can still see the project by lauching html/Oceane_Berthe_FrontEnd_Developer_index.html

### Access to the different pages

1. Explore page : it's the home. You can go back to it by clicking on Prepr's logo (top left corner of the page) or by selecting "Explore" in the menu
2. Projects page : click on the user icon and select "My projects"
3. Challenges page : click on "Challenges" in the navbar
4. Challenge details page : click on a challenge, presented in the Challenges page
5. Labs page : click on "Labs" in the navbar

I only had time to implement the first page (Explore page).
